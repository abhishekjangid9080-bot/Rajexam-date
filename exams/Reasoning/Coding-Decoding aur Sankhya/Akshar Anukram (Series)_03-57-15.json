Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants me to create 10 high-quality MCQs for the Reasoning section, specifically on Coding-Decoding and Number/Letter Series. The target exams are Rajasthan State Exams (LDC, CET, RAS), SSC, and Railway (NTPC). The questions need to be in both Hindi and English, following the Testbook style. The JSON structure provided is strict, so I need to adhere to that.

First, I'll start with the subject and topic as given. Now, for each question, I need to think of a coding-decoding problem or a letter/number series. Let's brainstorm some examples. 

For coding-decoding, maybe using alphabetical positions (like A=1, B=2) or shifting letters. For series, maybe alternating patterns, mathematical sequences, or alphabetical sequences with steps.

Let me start with a coding question. Suppose the code for a word is given by shifting letters by a certain number. For example, if "APPLE" is coded as "BQQMF," each letter is shifted by 1. Then the question could be "What is the code for 'ORANGE'?" The answer would be "PSBOHF."

Another example: Number series like 2, 5, 10, 17, 26... Here, each term increases by +3, +5, +7, +9, so the next term is 37. The pattern is n²+1: 1²+1=2, 2²+1=5, etc.

For letter series, maybe A, C, E, G... which increases by 2 letters each time, next is I. Or something more complex like A, Z, B, Y, C, X... alternating between increasing and decreasing.

I need to ensure that the answers are correct and explanations are clear in both languages. Also, the difficulty level should be appropriate for the mentioned exams. Let's create 10 such questions, mixing both coding-decoding and series types. I'll check each for clarity and correctness, making sure the options are plausible and the answers are unambiguous.

Actually, it's alternating shifts: Z→Z (no shift), E→F→C (shift +1 then -3), B→C→D (shift +1), R→S→T (shift +1), A→A→A (no shift). Wait, this is unclear. Let me correct. Actually, the correct pattern is that each letter is shifted one forward except the first letter which remains the same. So Z→Z, E→F (but actual code is C, which is E+2). Hmm, there's confusion here. Let me ensure the correct pattern. Original word 'ZEBRA' → Code 'ZCDSA'. Breaking down: Z→Z (no shift), E→C (shift -2), B→D (shift +2), R→S (shift +1), A→A (no shift). This seems inconsistent. To resolve, let's find a better explanation. Alternatively, the code might be replacing letters with their reverse positions (Z=1, Y=2...). Z=1, E=5 (reverse of 22), B=2 (reverse of 26), R=18 (reverse of 9), A=26 (reverse of 1). But this also doesn't fit.
