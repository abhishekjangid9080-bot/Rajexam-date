Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants 10 high-quality MCQs on Analogy and Classification in Reasoning for Rajasthan exams, SSC, and Railway. The instructions are to create questions in both Hindi and English, following a specific JSON structure.

First, I need to ensure I understand the subjects. Analogy questions involve identifying relationships between pairs, while Classification is about grouping items based on common traits. For each question, I'll create a question in English and Hindi, four options in both languages, the correct answer, and explanations in both languages.

I should start by brainstorming different types of analogies and classifications. For example, for Analogy, maybe something like animal to habitat, or synonyms. For Classification, maybe identifying the odd one out based on a category.

Let me think of the first question. Maybe a simple analogy: Dog : Puppy. The answer would be Cat : Kitten. Then create that in both languages. Then another analogy with numbers, like 3 : 27. The relationship here is cube. So next could be 2 : 8. Then another one like Bird : Sky, so Fish : Water.

For Classification, maybe three items that are types of a category and one that isn't. For example, Apple, Banana, Orange, Grapes – all fruits, but maybe include a vegetable like Carrot. Or for a classification question: Pen, Pencil, Eraser, Book – here Book is the odd one out because it's not a writing instrument.

I need to make sure the questions are at the appropriate difficulty level for the exams mentioned. Also, check that the explanations clearly explain the relationship or classification reason.

Let me list out possible questions:

1. Analogy: Dog : Puppy :: Cat : ?
2. Analogy: 3 : 27 :: 2 : ?
3. Analogy: Bird : Sky :: Fish : ?
4. Classification: Apple, Banana, Orange, Carrot
5. Analogy: Book : Shelf :: Clothes : ?
6. Classification: Pen, Pencil, Eraser, Book
7. Analogy: Cricket : Bat :: Hockey : ?
8. Classification: Square, Rectangle, Triangle, Sphere
9. Analogy: Teacher : School :: Doctor : ?
10. Classification: Cow, Goat, Hen, Cat

Now, translate each question into Hindi, ensuring the options are correctly translated. For example, Dog : Puppy in Hindi would be कुत्ता : वल्हन. The answer options for the first question would be Kitten, Cub, Lamb, etc., which in Hindi are किशोर, भेड़, बछड़ा, etc.

For explanations, I need to clearly state the relationship. For example, in the first question, the explanation is that a puppy is a young dog, so a kitten is a young cat.

I'll need to verify that each question follows the JSON structure exactly, with all required fields and proper language. Also, ensure that the answer choices are in the correct order and that the correct answer is marked properly.

Let me check each question for accuracy. For example, in the classification question with Square, Rectangle, Triangle, Sphere – Sphere is the odd one as it's 3D, others are 2D shapes. The explanation should clarify that.

Also, for the Teacher : School :: Doctor : ? analogy, the answer is Hospital, which in Hindi is अस्पताल. The options should include other places like Office, College, etc.

I need to make sure there are no typos in the translations and that the terms used are appropriate for the exams. Since these are for Rajasthan exams, some terms might be specific but in the given context, standard terms should suffice.

Once all questions are drafted, I'll format them into the JSON structure as specified, ensuring that each entry has the correct keys and values, and that the explanations are in both languages.
