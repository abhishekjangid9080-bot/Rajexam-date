Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality MCQs for the current affairs topic. The user mentioned that the questions should be in Hindi and English, following the Testbook style, and in a strict JSON format. Let me start by thinking about recent current affairs events relevant to Rajasthan, SSC, and Railway exams. 

First, I'll brainstorm some topics. Recent ones could include government schemes, notable appointments, sports achievements, and cultural events. For example, Rajasthan's new Chief Minister, any recent sports achievements by Indian athletes, or new policies announced in 2023.

Next, I need to ensure that each question has both Hindi and English translations. The options should be in both languages as well. The answer and explanations should also be in both languages. Let me check the example structure provided to make sure I follow the format correctly.

I need to avoid any markdown and provide only the JSON output. Let me start drafting one question at a time. For example, the first question could be about the new Chief Minister of Rajasthan. The answer would be Bhajan Lal Sharma, but wait, I should double-check that. Wait, as of my last update, the current Chief Minister of Rajasthan is Bhajan Lal Sharma, but I need to confirm the latest information. Let me verify that. Yes, he is still the CM as of 2023.

Another question could be about the recent Padma Awards. I should check who received the Padma Shri in 2023 for contributions to literature. Maybe someone from Rajasthan? Or perhaps a sports achievement, like a gold medal in the Asian Games. Let me think of specific events.

I need to ensure that the questions are of the correct difficulty level for competitive exams. They shouldn't be too trivial. Each question should have four options, with the correct answer clearly indicated. The explanations should be concise and accurate.

Let me start structuring each question. For example, a question about the new railway zone in India. Recently, there was news about the establishment of a new railway zone in Gujarat, but I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe the recent budget announcements related to railways.

I also need to cover various sub-topics like national, international, sports, and cultural events. For each question, I'll make sure the Hindi translation is accurate. Maybe I can use online translation tools for the Hindi part but also check for any nuances.

Let me list out 10 topics first:

1. New Chief Minister of Rajasthan (2023)
2. Padma Shri Award 2023 recipient from Rajasthan
3. Recent sports achievement in Asian Games 2023
4. New railway zone established in 2023
5. International Yoga Day 2023 host city
6. G20 Summit 2023 host country
7. Notable Indian scientist honored in 2023
8. Recent cultural event in Rajasthan
9. New government policy in Rajasthan 2023
10. Recent space mission by ISRO in 2023

Now, I'll elaborate each into a question. For each, I need to verify the correct answers. For example, the 2023 G20 Summit is hosted by India, so the answer is India. The host city for International Yoga Day 2023 was Delhi. ISRO's recent mission might be Chandrayaan-3 or Aditya-L1.

Wait, Chandrayaan-3 was in 2023 as well. Aditya-L1 is a solar mission planned for 2023. Let me confirm the exact details.

Once the topics are set, I'll structure each question with the required fields. The explanations should be brief but informative. For example, if a question is about the new railway zone, the explanation would state the name and location of the new zone.

I need to ensure that the JSON structure is correct, with all the necessary keys and proper syntax. No extra text, just the raw JSON. Each question should be an object within an array. Let me start compiling each question step by step, ensuring accuracy and proper language translation.
