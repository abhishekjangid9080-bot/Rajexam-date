Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They need 10 high-quality MCQs on Current Affairs for exams like Rajasthan LDC, CET, RAS, SSC, and Railway. The questions should be in both Hindi and English, following the Testbook style, and in strict JSON format. The example provided uses a simple structure with subject, topic, question in both languages, options, answer, and explanations.

First, I need to identify current topics relevant to these exams. Since it's Current Affairs, topics should be recent, maybe from the past year. Possible areas could be government schemes, appointments, sports achievements, international relations, etc.

Let me brainstorm some recent events. For instance, India's G20 presidency in 2022-2023, the new railway minister, significant sports events like the Asian Games 2023, new defense systems, and national awards. Also, environmental initiatives like the International Solar Alliance.

Next, I need to structure each question. Each question should have four options, with the correct answer labeled A to D. The explanations should be concise but informative, confirming the correct answer and why.

I must ensure that the Hindi and English versions are accurate translations. For example, "G20 Presidency 2023 Host Country" in English would be "2023 में जी20 की अध्यक्षता वाला देश" in Hindi.

Let me check the difficulty level. Since it's Current Affairs, some questions might be straightforward (like host countries), while others might require knowing specific details (like the name of the new railway minister or the number of medals won in a specific event).

I need to verify the facts. For example, India's G20 presidency in 2023 is accurate. The current Railway Minister is Ashwini Vaishnaw. The Asian Games 2023 were in Hangzhou, and India won 107 medals. The 52nd National Games were in Haryana. The Padma Vibhushan award for 2023 went to someone like R. Balakrishnan. The BrahMos is a supersonic cruise missile. The International Solar Alliance is led by India and France. The newly commissioned aircraft carrier is INS Vikrant.

Wait, I should confirm these details. For example, the Padma Vibhushan 2023 recipients include prominent figures. Let me check: R. Balakrishnan, a former IAS officer, did receive it. The BrahMos is indeed a joint venture between India and Russia. The International Solar Alliance was launched by India and France.

For the National Games, Haryana hosted the 2022 edition, but maybe the 2023 is upcoming? Wait, the last National Games were in 2022 in Haryana. The next might be in 2023, but if the question is about the host, I need to confirm. Let me verify: The 36th National Games were held in Haryana in 2022. The next one is scheduled for 2023, but the host might still be Haryana. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the 2023 host, which is yet to be determined. Hmm, perhaps I should adjust that to a past event to avoid inaccuracies.

Similarly, the number of medals in Asian Games 2023: India won 28 gold, 39 silver, and 40 bronze, totaling 107. That's correct.

I should also ensure that the options are plausible. For example, for the host country of G20 2023, options could include India, USA, UK, etc. The correct answer is India.

Now, structuring each question in JSON format, making sure the keys are correct and the explanations are in both languages. Need to avoid any markdown and ensure the JSON is properly formatted.

Let me draft each question one by one, checking for accuracy and proper translation. Also, ensure that the difficulty level is appropriate for the target exams.
