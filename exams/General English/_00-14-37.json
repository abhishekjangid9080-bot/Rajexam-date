Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality MCQs for the topic "General English" as per the instructions. The user wants the questions in both Hindi and English, with answers and explanations in both languages. The structure should follow the provided JSON example. Let me start by selecting the topic. Wait, the user didn't specify a particular sub-topic under General English. Hmm, maybe they just want general English questions covering grammar, vocabulary, etc. 

First, I'll decide on the types of questions. Common areas in General English for exams like LDC, CET, RAS, SSC, and Railway include grammar (tenses, prepositions, articles), vocabulary (synonyms, antonyms, one-word substitutions), sentence correction, error detection, and reading comprehension. Let me pick a variety of these.

For each question, I need to translate the question and options into Hindi. I should ensure the translation is accurate and natural. Also, the answers and explanations must be in both languages. Let me start drafting.

Question 1: Synonym for 'Abandon'. English options: A. Keep, B. Leave, C. Build, D. Repair. Hindi translation: A. रखे, B. छोड़े, C. बनाएं, D. मरम्मत करें. Answer is B. Explanation in both languages.

Question 2: Correct sentence structure. For example, "He go to school every day" has an error. Correct it as "He goes to school..." Options: A. He go..., B. He goes..., etc. Hindi translation accordingly.

Question 3: Preposition usage. "She is interested ___ music." Options: A. in, B. at, C. on, D. with.

Question 4: Antonym of 'Cheat'. Options: A. Honest, B. Lazy, C. Brave, D. Quick.

Question 5: One-word substitution. "A person who believes in fate." Options: A. Optimist, B. Fatalist, C. Pessimist, D. Philosopher.

Question 6: Sentence correction. "Neither of the boys are guilty." Correct form: "Neither of the boys is guilty."

Question 7: Choose the correct preposition: "The book is ___ the table." Options: A. in, B. on, C. at, D. under.

Question 8: Identify the part of speech of the underlined word in "She sings a song." Underlined word is "sings." Options: A. Noun, B. Verb, C. Adjective, D. Adverb.

Question 9: Correct spelling. Options like A. Accomodate, B. Accommodate, C. Acommodate, D. Accommadate.

Question 10: Identify the correctly spelled word. Options similar to above.

Now, translating each question into Hindi. Need to ensure that the Hindi translations are accurate and make sense in context. Also, check that the answer options are correctly translated and the explanations are clear in both languages.

Let me check for consistency in answer options. For example, in question 1, the correct answer is B. Leave, so in Hindi it's B. छोड़े. The explanation should clearly state that 'abandon' means to leave something behind.

For each question, ensure that the JSON structure matches the example. Make sure all keys are present: subject, topic, question_en, question_hi, options (A, B, C, D in both languages), answer, explanations in both languages.

Let me verify the JSON syntax. Each question should be an object within an array. Keys should be in quotes, and strings should be properly escaped if necessary. Since the user wants raw JSON without any extra text, I need to ensure that there are no markdown elements or additional explanations.

After creating all 10 questions, I'll review them to check for any errors in grammar, translation, or structure. Also, confirm that the difficulty level is appropriate for the target exams, not too hard or too easy. For example, the questions should test basic understanding but still be challenging enough for exam preparation.
