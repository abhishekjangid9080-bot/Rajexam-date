Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality multiple-choice questions for the General English subject, specifically on the topic provided. The user wants each question and options in both Hindi and English, following the Testbook style. The JSON format is strict, so I must adhere to the structure given in the example.

First, I should decide on a topic. Since the user didn't specify a particular topic under General English, maybe they expect common areas like grammar, vocabulary, or comprehension. Let's go with Vocabulary and Grammar as the topic since those are fundamental and commonly tested.

Next, I need to generate 10 questions. Each question should have a question in English and Hindi, options labeled A to D with both languages, the correct answer, and explanations in both languages. Let me start brainstorming possible questions.

1. **Synonym/Antonym Questions**: These are standard. For example, "What is the synonym of 'Generous'?" with options. Then provide the answer and explanation.

2. **Idioms and Phrases**: Questions like "What does the idiom 'Under the weather' mean?" with options explaining each.

3. **Sentence Correction**: Provide a sentence with an error and ask to identify the correct version.

4. **Prepositions**: Questions where the correct preposition is needed in a sentence.

5. **Tenses**: Identify the correct tense form of a verb.

6. **One-word Substitutes**: Find a single word that replaces a phrase.

7. **Active/Passive Voice**: Convert sentences between active and passive voice.

8. **Direct/Indirect Speech**: Change sentences from direct to indirect and vice versa.

9. **Subject-Verb Agreement**: Choose the correct verb form based on the subject.

10. **Punctuation**: Correctly punctuate a sentence.

Now, for each question, I need to ensure that the Hindi translation is accurate. For example, "Choose the correct preposition to complete the sentence: 'She is interested ___ reading books.'" The Hindi question would be "वाक्य को पूरा करने के लिए सही सम्मुख शब्द चुनें: 'वह पुस्तकों के पढ़ने में रुचि रखती है।'"

Options need to be in both languages. For example, the options for the preposition question could be A. in, B. on, C. at, D. with. In Hindi, A. में, B. पर, C. पर, D. के साथ.

The answer is A, and the explanation would be that "interested in" is the correct preposition.

I need to ensure that the difficulty level is appropriate for exams like Rajasthan State Exams, SSC, and Railway. So the questions shouldn't be too easy or too hard. They should test understanding without being trick questions.

Let me start drafting each question step by step, making sure the JSON structure is followed. I'll check each question for clarity and correctness in both languages. Also, explanations should be concise and accurate.

For example, a question on sentence correction: "Identify the correct sentence: A. He don't like apples. B. He doesn't like apples. C. He isn't like apples. D. He doesn't likes apples." The correct answer is B, and the explanation is that "doesn't" is used with third person singular.

Another example: "What is the past perfect tense of 'go'? A. Gone B. Went C. Had gone D. Going." The answer is C, as past perfect is "had gone".

I need to create 10 such questions, ensuring variety in topics covered. Let me list them out:

1. Synonym for 'Generous'
2. Antonym for 'Cautious'
3. Idiom 'Under the weather'
4. Correct preposition in "interested ___"
5. Correct verb form in "They ___ (go) to school every day."
6. One-word substitute for a person who collects stamps
7. Active to passive voice conversion
8. Correct sentence structure among options
9. Direct speech to indirect speech conversion
10. Punctuation correction in "The sun shines brightly"

Now, translating each into Hindi and ensuring options are correctly placed. Also, the explanations must clarify why the correct answer is right.

I should also check for any possible errors in translation or in the options. For instance, in the passive voice question, making sure the structure is correctly converted.

Once all 10 questions are drafted, I'll compile them into the JSON structure as specified, making sure the keys are correct and the order of options is maintained (A, B, C, D). Finally, validate the JSON to ensure no syntax errors.
