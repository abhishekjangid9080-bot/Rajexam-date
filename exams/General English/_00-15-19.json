Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The user wants me to create 10 high-quality MCQs for General English, specifically for Rajasthan state exams, SSC, and Railway exams. The topic isn't specified, but since it's General English, it's likely covering grammar, vocabulary, and maybe some comprehension.

First, I need to ensure that each question has both Hindi and English versions. The options (A, B, C, D) must also be in both languages. The example given is about the capital of Rajasthan, but since the actual topic isn't provided, I should think of common English topics that are relevant for these exams.

Possible topics could be tenses, prepositions, synonyms/antonyms, sentence structure, error detection, etc. Let me brainstorm some questions. For example, a question on correct verb forms, preposition usage, sentence correction, etc.

Let me start drafting the first question. Maybe a question on prepositions. The English question could be "Choose the correct preposition: She is allergic ___ nuts." The options: A) to, B) with, C) of, D) at. The correct answer is A) to. Then I need to translate this into Hindi, ensuring the translation is accurate. The explanation should clarify why 'to' is the correct preposition here.

Another question could be on synonyms. For example, "What is the synonym of 'meticulous'?" Options: A) Careless, B) Precise, C) Lazy, D) Hasty. The answer is B) Precise. The Hindi version should have the same structure.

I need to make sure that the difficulty level is appropriate for the target exams. They shouldn't be too hard but should challenge the students' understanding. Also, the explanations should be concise and clear in both languages.

Let me check the JSON structure provided. Each question should have subject, topic, question in English and Hindi, options in both languages, answer (A/B/C/D), and explanations in both languages. The example given uses the topic as empty, but maybe I should fill it in with something like "Grammar" or "Vocabulary" for clarity.

Wait, the user didn't specify the topic, so maybe I should leave it as an empty string as in the example. That's okay. Now, I'll start creating 10 questions. Let me think of different topics each time to cover a range of General English areas.

For example:

1. Prepositions
2. Synonyms
3. Antonyms
4. Sentence correction
5. Tenses
6. Articles (a/an/the)
7. Error detection
8. Idioms and phrases
9. Sentence arrangement
10. One-word substitution

Each of these can form a question. Let me outline each one with the necessary parts. For each question, I'll translate the question, options, and explanations into Hindi. Need to be careful with translation to maintain the same meaning.

Let's take the first topic: Prepositions. The question "Choose the correct preposition: She is allergic ___ nuts." The correct answer is A) to. Explanation in English: "The correct preposition after 'allergic' is 'to'." In Hindi: "allergic के बाद सही सर्वनाम 'to' होता है।"

Another example: Tenses. "Change the sentence to past perfect tense: He eats an apple." Options: A) He has eaten... etc. The correct answer is the past perfect form, which is "He had eaten an apple." The explanation would clarify the tense change.

For antonyms: "What is the antonym of 'happiness'?" Options: A) Joy, B) Pleasure, C) Sadness, D) Contentment. Answer is C) Sadness.

I need to ensure that the options are plausible distractors. For example, in the antonym question, the incorrect options should be real words but not the correct antonym.

Now, for each question, I'll structure the JSON accordingly. Let me start writing them out, making sure the Hindi translations are accurate. Also, the answer key (A/B/C/D) must correspond correctly. After drafting all 10, I'll review them for consistency and correctness in both languages.
