Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality multiple-choice questions for the General English subject. The user wants the questions and options in both Hindi and English, following the Testbook style. The instructions specify a strict JSON format, so I must be careful to adhere to that structure.

First, let's identify the topic. The topic was left blank in the user's request, so I need to choose a topic under General English. Common topics could be grammar, vocabulary, comprehension, synonyms, antonyms, etc. Since the example given is about a capital city, which is geography, but the user specified General English, maybe the topic should be related to English language skills. Let me confirm the example again. The example given is about Rajasthan's capital, which is a geography question, but the subject is General English. That might be a mistake. Wait, maybe the user provided an example for the format but the actual task is for General English. So the topic should be related to English language topics like grammar, vocabulary, etc.

Wait, the user's initial message says the task is for the subject General English and topic is left blank. So I need to define the topic for each question. For example, topics under General English could be Tenses, Prepositions, Synonyms, Antonyms, Idioms, Sentence Correction, etc.

So, I'll need to create 10 questions each with a different or similar topic under General English. Let's list possible topics:

1. Prepositions
2. Tenses
3. Synonyms
4. Antonyms
5. Idioms and Phrases
6. Sentence Correction
7. Parts of Speech
8. Error Spotting
9. Fill in the Blanks
10. One Word Substitution

Now, for each question, I need to create the question in both Hindi and English, four options in both languages, the correct answer, and explanations in both languages.

Let me start with the first question on Prepositions. The question could be about choosing the correct preposition. For example, "She is afraid ___ snakes." The options would be "of", "for", "to", "with". The explanation would state that "afraid of" is the correct phrase.

Next, a Tense question. For example, changing a sentence to past perfect tense. The question in English: "He ___ (go) to school yesterday." The correct answer would be "had gone", and the explanation that past perfect is used for an action completed before another past action.

For Synonyms, a question asking for the synonym of "happy", with options like "joyful", "sad", etc.

Antonyms could be a question asking for the opposite of "increase", with options like "decrease", "expand", etc.

An Idiom question: "To break the ice" meaning, with options like "start a conversation", "end a relationship", etc.

Sentence Correction: "I am more taller than him" – correct to "I am taller than him".

Parts of Speech: Identify the part of speech of "run" in the sentence "He runs fast."

Error Spotting: A sentence with an error, like "They is going to the market." The error is "is" should be "are".

Fill in the Blanks: "Please give me ___ water." Options: "some", "any", "many", "much".

One Word Substitution: A phrase that can be replaced by a single word.

Now, translating each question and option into Hindi, making sure the translations are accurate. For example, "She is afraid of snakes" in Hindi would be "वह सांपों से डरती है।"

I need to ensure that the translations are correct and the explanations in both languages are clear. Also, check that the answer options are in the right order and the correct answer is marked properly.

Let me start drafting each question one by one, following the structure provided. I need to make sure the JSON is properly formatted with no syntax errors, using commas correctly, and all keys are present. Each question object should have subject, topic, question in both languages, options A-D in both languages, answer, and explanations in both languages.

I'll also need to check that the difficulty level is appropriate for exams like Rajasthan State Exams, SSC, and Railway. The questions should be of moderate difficulty, testing basic understanding of English grammar and vocabulary.

After creating all 10 questions, I will review them to ensure they meet the requirements and that there are no duplicates or errors in the content.
