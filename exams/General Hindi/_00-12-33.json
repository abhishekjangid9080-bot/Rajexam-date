Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants 10 high-quality MCQs in General Hindi for exams like Rajasthan LDC, CET, RAS, SSC, and Railway. The instructions mention that each question and options should be in both Hindi and English, formatted in JSON. The example provided is about Rajasthan's capital, so maybe I should follow a similar structure.

First, I need to decide on the topic. The user left the topic blank, so I should choose common General Hindi topics. Let's think about areas like grammar, vocabulary, sentence structure, common idioms, or standard questions like synonyms/antonyms. Since Rajasthan exams often include regional language questions, maybe including some Rajasthani words or local context would be good.

Wait, the example was a straightforward question. Let me brainstorm topics: synonyms, antonyms, correct word usage, sentence correction, parts of speech, common errors, idioms, etc. Since the example was a simple factual question, maybe start with that structure but vary the topics.

Let me list out 10 different topics. For example:

1. Synonyms for a word.
2. Antonyms.
3. One-word substitution.
4. Sentence correction.
5. Correct spelling.
6. Idioms and phrases.
7. Parts of speech.
8. Fill in the blank with correct preposition.
9. Correct form of a word (tense, etc.).
10. Meaning of a proverb or idiom.

Each question should have a clear answer. Let's start drafting each one, ensuring both English and Hindi translations. Also, explanations in both languages. Need to make sure the difficulty is appropriate for the target exams. Avoid very obscure words but still include some that are commonly tested.

For example, first question: "Which of the following is a synonym for 'beautiful'?" with options like 'Sundar', 'Vishal', etc. Answer is Sundar. Explanation in both languages.

Another question on antonyms: "Opposite of 'light' is..." with options like 'heavy', 'bright', etc. Answer is heavy.

One-word substitution: "A person who believes in the principle of non-violence is called..." Answer: Ahimsak.

Sentence correction: "He has gone to Delhi (Correct tense)" options with different tenses.

Spelling: Which is correct? Options with common spelling mistakes.

Idiom meaning: "To hit the nail on the head" means...

Parts of speech: Identify the part of speech of the word "quickly".

Prepositions: "She is good ___ singing." Answer: at.

Correct form of verb: "They ___ going to the market. (Present continuous)" Answer: are.

Proverb meaning: "The early bird catches the worm."

Now, I need to structure each of these 10 into the JSON format provided. Ensure that the subject is "General Hindi", topic filled appropriately, and all fields are correctly translated. Check that the answer keys are correct and explanations are clear.

Let me start writing each question step by step, making sure translations are accurate and options are plausible. For example, in the synonym question, the options should be close but with one correct answer. Also, avoid using the same structure for all questions to vary the difficulty and type.

After drafting all 10, I'll review them for consistency, correct translations, and adherence to the topic. Make sure explanations are concise and directly support the correct answer. Also, check that the JSON syntax is correct, with proper commas and brackets, to avoid formatting errors.
