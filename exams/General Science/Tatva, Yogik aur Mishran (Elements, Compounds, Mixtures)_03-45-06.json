Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants 10 high-quality MCQs in both Hindi and English for General Science, specifically on Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures. They need the questions to follow the JSON structure provided, with testbook style, and the difficulty level appropriate for Rajasthan State Exams, SSC, and Railway exams. 

First, I need to brainstorm topics related to elements, compounds, and mixtures. Let's start with basic definitions. For example, distinguishing between elements and compounds. Maybe a question on which is an element versus a compound. Then, mixtures can be homogeneous or heterogeneous. 

Next, examples of each category. For elements, copper (Cu) is an element. Water (H2O) is a compound. Air is a mixture. Then, properties: elements can't be broken down chemically, compounds can be broken down into elements, mixtures can be separated physically. 

Another angle could be identifying which of the options is a mixture. Maybe something like salt solution or alloys. Also, alloys are homogeneous mixtures. 

I should also consider common examples students might confuse. For instance, sugar is a compound, not an element. Iron is an element. Maybe a question on which is a compound: CO2, CaO, etc. 

Need to ensure the language is clear and in Hindi and English. Each question should have four options, with one correct answer. The explanations should be concise but sufficient to clarify why the answer is correct.

Let me start drafting questions. First question: Which of the following is an element? Options could be water, copper, salt, air. Copper is an element. Second question: Which is a compound? Water is H2O. Third question: Which is a homogeneous mixture? Air is a homogeneous mixture. Fourth question: Which can be separated by physical means? Mixtures. 

Wait, need to check if all the options are correctly categorized. For example, alloys like steel are mixtures. Also, elements have symbols like O for oxygen. 

Another question: Which is a pure substance? Elements and compounds are pure substances. Mixtures are not. So, a question on pure substances. 

I need to make sure each question is unique and tests different concepts. Let me list out possible questions and their options. Let's see, maybe 10 questions covering elements, compounds, mixtures, examples, properties, separation methods. 

Also, explanations should clarify the correct answer. For example, if the question is about elements, the explanation should state that elements are pure substances made of one type of atom. 

I should check for any possible errors in the options. For example, carbon dioxide is a compound, sodium is an element, air is a mixture. 

Once the questions are drafted, I'll structure them into the required JSON format, making sure all fields are filled. Let me start writing each question step by step, ensuring the Hindi translations are accurate and the options are correctly presented.
