Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality MCQs on the topic of Panchayati Raj and Nagariya Swashasan (73rd and 74th Amendments) in Indian Polity. The user wants them in both Hindi and English, following the Testbook style, and in JSON format. Let me start by recalling the key points of these amendments.

The 73rd Amendment Act, 1992, relates to Panchayati Raj institutions, while the 74th Amendment Act, 1992, deals with urban local governments. I should focus on the constitutional provisions, reservation of seats, powers, and functions.

First, I need to ensure that each question tests understanding of the amendments. Let me brainstorm some areas: the constitutional articles involved, the reservation of seats for SCs, STs, and women, the powers of local bodies, the structure of the Panchayati Raj system, and the role of state governments.

For each question, I'll need to frame the question in English and Hindi, provide four options (A-D) in both languages, the correct answer, and explanations in both languages. Let me start with the first question about the constitutional articles. The 73rd and 74th Amendments are part of the Constitution through specific articles. The correct answer would be Article 243B and 243K respectively. That's a good first question.

Next, the 73rd Amendment provides for a three-tier system: village, intermediate, and district levels. A question on the structure would be useful. Then, reservations for women in Panchayats, which is 33%, is a key point. The 74th Amendment's objective is to provide urban local bodies constitutional status. Another question could be on the election of members, ensuring they are directly elected. Also, the reservation for SCs and STs in urban local bodies is 7.5% each. The role of state governments in relation to Panchayats, as per the 73rd Amendment, is to empower them to function as institutions of self-government. The 74th Amendment mentions the state legislature's power to delegate functions to urban local bodies. The 73rd Amendment ensures the establishment of a District Planning Committee. Lastly, the constitutional validity of the amendments, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1994.

I need to check the accuracy of these points. For example, the 73rd Amendment indeed reserves one-third of seats for women. The 74th Amendment allows for 7.5% reservations for SCs and STs. The Supreme Court did uphold the amendments in 1994. The state government's role is to confer powers to Panchayats. The election of members is directly elected. The three-tier structure is village, intermediate, and district. The District Planning Committee is established under the 73rd Amendment.

Now, I'll structure each question step by step, ensuring that options are plausible and the correct answer is clear. For example, for the constitutional articles, the options could be various articles, with the correct ones being 243B and 243K. For the reservation percentages, distractors could be 25%, 30%, etc. Similarly, for the election of members, options could include indirectly elected or nominated bodies.

I need to make sure that the explanations are concise and accurate. For instance, explaining that the 73rd Amendment provides constitutional status to Panchayats, and the 74th does the same for urban bodies. Also, clarifying the roles and reservations as per the amendments.

After drafting all questions, I'll review them to ensure they cover different aspects of the topic and that there's no repetition. Each question should test a different element of the amendments. Finally, I'll format them into JSON, ensuring that the structure matches the provided example and that all fields are correctly filled. I need to be careful with the Hindi translations to maintain accuracy and clarity.
