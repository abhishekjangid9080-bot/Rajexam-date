Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality MCQs on the topic of Panchayati Raj and Nagariya Swashasan, specifically covering the 73rd and 74th Amendments. Let me start by recalling the key points of these amendments.

First, the 73rd Amendment Act, 1992, is about Panchayati Raj. It introduced local self-government in rural areas. Important aspects include the establishment of three-tier systems (Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Samiti, Zila Parishad), reservation of seats for SCs, STs, and women, elections, and financial autonomy.

The 74th Amendment Act, 1992, deals with urban local bodies (Municipalities). It provides a constitutional status to Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) like Municipal Corporations, Municipal Councils, and Nagar Panchayats. It also includes similar reservations and provisions for elections and financial matters.

Now, for each question, I need to make sure it tests the understanding of these amendments. Let me think of possible questions:

1. When were the 73rd and 74th Amendments passed? They were both passed in 1992.
2. What is the structure of Panchayati Raj under 73rd Amendment? Three-tier system.
3. Reservation of seats for women in Panchayats? At least one-third.
4. Reservation for SCs and STs in urban local bodies? Similar to the rural ones, as per 74th Amendment.
5. What is the minimum population for a Nagar Panchayat according to 74th Amendment? The 74th Amendment doesn't specify a population, but Nagar Panchayats are for urban areas with specific criteria. Maybe the question can be about the type of urban body.
6. Which article deals with the 73rd Amendment? Article 243B to 243O.
7. What is the maximum number of seats reserved for SC/ST in Panchayats? Cannot exceed one-third.
8. Who is the head of a Gram Panchayat? Sarpanch.
9. What is the tenure of a Panchayat? Five years.
10. Functions of Urban Local Bodies under 74th Amendment? Includes planning, sanitation, water supply, etc.

Now, I need to frame these into questions with options. Let me check for accuracy. For example, the 73rd Amendment mandates at least one-third reservation for women. The 74th Amendment also has similar reservations. The Sarpanch is the head of Gram Panchayat. The three-tier system is Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Samiti, and Zila Parishad. The tenure is five years. Urban local bodies include Municipal Corporations, Municipal Councils, and Nagar Panchayats. The 73rd Amendment was passed in 1992, and the 74th in the same year.

I need to make sure that the options are plausible and the correct answer is clear. For example, in the question about the structure, options could be three-tier, two-tier, etc. The explanations need to be concise and accurate.

Also, the questions should cover a range of difficulty, from basic recall to understanding specific provisions. Let me verify each answer to avoid mistakes. For example, the 73rd Amendment's articles are from 243B to 243O. The 74th Amendment covers similar articles but for urban bodies. The maximum reservation for SC/ST cannot exceed one-third, which is a key point. The minimum population for Nagar Panchayat is not specified in the amendment but may be covered by state laws.

I think that covers the main points. Now, structuring each question with Hindi and English translations, options, answer, and explanation. Need to ensure the JSON format is correct, with all keys present. Also, the Hindi options should be accurate translations. Let me proceed to draft each question accordingly.
