Okay, let's start by understanding the user's requirements. They need 10 high-quality MCQs on the topic of Panchayati Raj and Nagariya Swashasan under the 73rd and 74th Amendments to the Indian Constitution. The questions should be in both Hindi and English, following the Testbook style. The JSON structure provided is strict, so I need to ensure each question includes all required fields without any extra text.

First, I'll recall the key points of the 73rd and 74th Amendments. The 73rd Amendment relates to Panchayati Raj institutions, while the 74th Amendment is about Urban Local Bodies. Important aspects include the constitutional status, reservation of seats for SCs, STs, and women, powers and functions, and the structure of these bodies.

I need to create diverse questions testing different aspects. Let's brainstorm possible questions. For example, the year of enactment, the constitutional article numbers, reservation percentages, functions of these bodies, and differences between the two amendments. Each question should have four options, with the correct answer marked.

Next, I'll draft each question in both languages. For instance, the first question could be about the year both amendments were enacted. The answer is 1992. I'll create plausible distractors by using other years when significant constitutional changes happened.

Then, another question might ask which amendment deals with urban local bodies. The answer is 74th. I'll ensure the options include the 73rd Amendment, other amendments, and possibly unrelated ones.

For reservation, the 73rd Amendment reserves 1/3rd of seats for women. The options should include this and other percentages to test knowledge.

I also need to cover the structure, like the three-tier system under 73rd Amendment. The options should include the three tiers: Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Samiti, and Zila Parishad.

Functions of these bodies are crucial. For example, the 73rd Amendment gives them constitutional status and powers to prepare plans for economic development and social justice.

Each explanation should clearly state why the correct answer is right and why others are incorrect. I'll check for accuracy, ensuring that all facts are correct according to the Indian Constitution.

Now, translating all parts into Hindi. The Hindi questions and options must be accurate and natural. For example, "राज्य स्तरीय नगर निगम के नाम से क्या जाना जाता है?" translates to "What is the name of the State-level municipal corporation?" with options in Hindi.

Once the questions are drafted, I'll verify each for clarity and correctness. Ensuring that each question is unambiguous and options are well-structured. Finally, format the JSON correctly, making sure all keys are present and properly nested. Avoid any markdown, just the raw JSON as specified.
