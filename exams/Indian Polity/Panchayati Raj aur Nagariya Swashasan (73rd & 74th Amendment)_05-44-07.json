Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants 10 high-quality MCQs on Panchayati Raj and Nagariya Swashasan, focusing on the 73rd and 74th Amendments. The questions need to be in both Hindi and English, with explanations. The format should be strict JSON as per the example.

First, I need to ensure I understand the key points of these amendments. The 73rd Amendment is about Panchayati Raj, introducing three tiers: village, block, and district. It mandates elections, reservation for SC/ST and women. The 74th Amendment deals with urban local bodies like municipalities, similar structure but for urban areas.

Now, for each question, I need to create a clear question in both languages. Let me brainstorm possible topics. Number of tiers, reservation percentages, power devolution, financial provisions, duration of terms, roles of Gram Sabha, etc.

Let me start with the first question: Which amendment introduced Panchayati Raj? The answer is 73rd. Make sure to mention the years, 1992 and 1993 for 73rd and 74th respectively.

Second question could be about the number of tiers. Three tiers: village, intermediate, district. That's a common question.

Third, reservation for SC/ST. The 73rd Amendment requires not less than 1/3 for women, but SC/ST reservation is 1/4th as per the Constitution. Wait, the 73rd Amendment doesn't specify the exact percentage for SC/ST; that's set by the state government. Hmm, maybe the question should be about the reservation for women. Yes, 33% is correct.

Fourth question: Who conducts elections? The State Election Commission, established under 73rd Amendment.

Fifth: Duration of Panchayat. Five years, unless dissolved earlier.

Sixth: Which subject is not listed in the 11th Schedule? The 73rd Amendment's 11th Schedule lists subjects for Panchayats. Land, agriculture, rural education, etc. Maybe something like "Railways" as it's a Union subject.

Seventh: Role of Gram Sabha. It's a preparatory body for Panchayat elections, so answer would be 'Preparation of electoral rolls'.

Eighth: 74th Amendment's urban counterpart. It's for municipalities, similar to 73rd for Panchayats.

Ninth: Reservation in urban bodies. 33% for women in urban areas as per 74th Amendment.

Tenth: Who is the head of the Panchayat? Sarpanch at the village level.

Wait, I need to check each point for accuracy. For example, the 74th Amendment's 12th Schedule lists subjects for municipalities. The 73rd Amendment's 11th. The reservation percentages might vary; need to confirm that 33% is the constitutional mandate for both. Also, ensure that the State Election Commission is the correct body for conducting elections.

Now, structure each question with options in both languages. Make sure translations are accurate. For explanations, clarify the key points. Avoid any ambiguity in the options. For example, in the question about the number of tiers, possible distractors could be 2 or 4 tiers.

Double-check the answer for each question. For example, the 74th Amendment came into effect in 1993. The 73rd in 1992. The 74th Amendment deals with Nagariya Swashasan (urban local bodies).

Once all questions are drafted, format them into JSON as per the example. Ensure the JSON syntax is correct, with commas and brackets properly placed. Also, check that the explanations clearly justify the correct answer.
