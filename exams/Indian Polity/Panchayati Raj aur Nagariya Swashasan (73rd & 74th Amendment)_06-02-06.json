Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality MCQs on Indian Polity focusing on Panchayati Raj and Nagariya Swashasan, specifically the 73rd and 74th Amendments. Let me start by recalling the key points of these amendments. The 73rd Amendment Act, 1992 is about Panchayats (Rural Local Governments), and the 74th Amendment Act, 1992 is about Municipalities (Urban Local Governments). Both amendments were passed in the same year but address different levels of local governance.

First question: The 73rd Amendment deals with which level of local government? Options could be Panchayats, Municipalities, Urban Local Bodies, or Zilla Parishads. The correct answer is Panchayats.

Second question: What about the 74th Amendment? That's for Municipalities. So similar structure but different answer.

Third question: When were these amendments passed? Both in 1992. So a question on the year.

Fourth question: Which constitutional article is related to the 73rd Amendment? Maybe Article 243. The 74th would then be Article 243T or similar. Need to check the exact articles.

Fifth question: The 73rd Amendment added which part to the Constitution? Part IX for Panchayats, Part IXA for Municipalities.

Sixth question: Reservation of seats for SCs, STs, and OBCs in Panchayats. The 73rd Amendment mandates this, so a question on reservation.

Seventh question: The 74th Amendment might address the reservation in urban bodies as well. So another reservation question.

Eighth question: The 73rd Amendment specifies the three-tier system: Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Samiti, Zila Parishad. A question on the tiers.

Ninth question: Powers of municipalities under the 74th Amendment. They have the power to prepare schemes for urban development.

Tenth question: Which act provides constitutional status to local self-government? The 73rd and 74th Amendments, as they were constitutional amendments.

Need to ensure that each question is in both Hindi and English, with options in both languages. Also, explanations in both languages. Let me verify the constitutional articles and parts to make sure the information is accurate. For example, Article 243B is about the Constitution of Panchayats. Article 243Y relates to the 74th Amendment. Part IX for Panchayats and Part IXA for Municipalities. Reservation percentages are 1/3 for women in 73rd Amendment. Also, the minimum age for membership: 25 for Panchayats, 21 for Municipalities. Let me structure each question carefully, ensuring the options are plausible and the answers are correct.
