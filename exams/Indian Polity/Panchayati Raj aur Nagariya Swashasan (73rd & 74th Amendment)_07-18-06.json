Okay, let's start by understanding the task. The user wants 10 high-quality MCQs on Indian Polity, specifically focusing on the Panchayati Raj and Nagariya Swashasan as covered by the 73rd and 74th Amendments. The questions need to be in both Hindi and English, following the Testbook style, and structured in a strict JSON format.

First, I need to recall the key points of the 73rd and 74th Amendments. The 73rd Amendment is about Panchayats (rural local governments), and the 74th is about Municipalities (urban). Important aspects include reservation of seats for SCs, STs, and women; the three-tier structure of Panchayats; the establishment of State Election Commissions; and the constitutional status given to these institutions.

I should ensure that each question tests a fundamental concept. Let me brainstorm some topics: reservation percentages, constitutional amendments, structure of Panchayats, powers and functions, State Election Commissions, three-tier systems, urban vs rural governance, implementation dates, and roles of different bodies.

Now, for each question, I need to frame it clearly in both languages. The options should be plausible but have a single correct answer. The explanations must be concise and accurate. I'll start with the first question on the reservation of seats for women in Panchayats as per the 73rd Amendment. The answer is 1/3, so the options will include that. Then move to the 74th Amendment's focus on urban areas. Next, the three-tier structure of Panchayats. The State Election Commission's role. The constitutional status date. Reservation for SC/ST. The minimum population for urban local bodies. The roles of Panchayats. The amendment that introduced local governance. And finally, the maximum number of seats reserved for SC/ST in urban areas.

I need to ensure that the options are in both languages and correctly matched. Also, check that the answers are accurate. For example, the 73rd Amendment was in 1992, not 1993. The three tiers are Gram Panchayat, Block, and Zila Parishad. The 74th Amendment deals with Municipalities. Reservation for women is 33%, so the option should reflect that. The State Election Commission is responsible for conducting elections. The minimum population for urban bodies is 30,000. The maximum reservation for SC/ST is 50%. The roles include planning and implementation. The 73rd Amendment introduced constitutional status. The 74th Amendment is for urban governance. The three-tier structure is three levels. The answer letters (A, B, C, D) must correspond correctly.

Once all questions are framed, I'll structure them into JSON as per the example. Each question object will have subject, topic, question in both languages, options in both languages, the correct answer, and explanations in both languages. Need to double-check for any typos or factual errors, especially in the Hindi translations. Make sure the explanations clearly justify the correct answer.
