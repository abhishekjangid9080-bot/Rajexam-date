Okay, let's start. The user wants me to create 10 high-quality MCQs for Static GK, specifically related to Rajasthan State Exams, SSC, and Railway. The topic isn't specified, so I need to cover various aspects of Static GK relevant to Rajasthan. 

First, I should think about important facts about Rajasthan. Capitals, historical figures, cultural aspects, important cities, state symbols, etc. Each question needs to be in both Hindi and English, with the same structure as the example provided.

Question 1: Capital of Rajasthan. The answer is Jaipur. I'll make sure options include other major cities like Jodhpur, Udaipur, Bikaner.

Question 2: Rajasthan's state bird. The answer is the Peacock. Other options can be other birds like Eagle, Parrot, Crow.

Question 3: Founder of Jaipur. Sawai Jai Singh II. Other options could be other Mughal or Rajput rulers.

Question 4: Rajasthan's state animal. Blue Bull (Nilgai). Options like Lion, Tiger, Elephant.

Question 5: Largest city in Rajasthan. Jaipur. Other options: Jodhpur, Bikaner, Kota.

Question 6: Rajasthan's state flower. Lotus. Other options could be Jasmine, Rose, Marigold.

Question 7: Currency of India. Rupee. Other options like Dollar, Euro, Yen.

Question 8: Rajasthan's state tree. Banyan. Other options: Neem, Peepal, Coconut.

Question 9: Capital of India. New Delhi. Other options: Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai.

Question 10: National animal of India. Tiger. Options: Lion, Elephant, Peacock.

Wait, some of these questions might be outside Rajasthan's scope. For example, the capital of India is a general GK question. Need to check if it's relevant. Since the user mentioned Static GK, which includes general knowledge, it's okay. But maybe include a question about Rajasthan's famous monuments, like the Taj Mahal? No, the Taj Mahal is in Agra. Wait, Rajasthan has Amber Fort, Hawa Mahal, etc. Maybe a question about which city is known as the city of lakes, which is Udaipur. That's a good point. So adjust question 5 to be about the city of lakes. Then maybe another question about the famous fort in Rajasthan, like Amber Fort in Jaipur. But let me think again.

Also, need to ensure the difficulty level is appropriate for the exams mentioned. So mix of easy, moderate, and a few tricky ones. For example, the founder of Jaipur is Sawai Jai Singh II, which might be a bit more specific. Need to confirm that fact. Also, check for any possible errors in the options.

Let me go step by step:

1. Capital of Rajasthan: Jaipur.
2. State bird: Peacock.
3. Founder of Jaipur: Sawai Jai Singh II.
4. State animal: Blue Bull.
5. City known as the City of Lakes: Udaipur.
6. State flower: Lotus.
7. Currency of India: Rupee.
8. State tree: Banyan.
9. Capital of India: New Delhi.
10. National animal of India: Tiger.

This seems to cover a good mix. Now, translating each question into Hindi and ensuring options are correctly translated. Also, explanations in both languages. Make sure the answer is clearly marked as the correct option. For example, in the city of lakes question, Udaipur is the correct answer. Check all the facts again to avoid mistakes. For instance, is the state flower of Rajasthan really Lotus? Or is it some other flower? Let me verify. Rajasthan's state flower is Lotus (Kamal) according to official sources. State tree is Banyan (Bargad). State animal is Blue Bull (Nilgai). State bird is Peacock. Yes, all correct.

Okay, structuring each question with the required JSON format. Ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted with proper commas and brackets. Also, check that the answer keys are correctly assigned (like B, C, etc.) based on the options provided.
