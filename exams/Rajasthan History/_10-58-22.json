Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality MCQs on Rajasthan History for exams like LDC, CET, RAS, SSC, and Railway NTPC. The user wants each question in both Hindi and English, following the Testbook style. Let me start by recalling key historical events and important figures in Rajasthan's history.

First, I should identify the main topics within Rajasthan History. The Rulers of Rajputana kingdoms are important, like Rana Pratap Singh. Then there's the Mughal period, the role of Rajputs, and the integration into the Indian Union after independence. Also, important battles like the Battle of Haldighati come to mind. Cultural aspects like the Chittorgarh Fort, which is a UNESCO site, might be relevant. The Pratihara dynasty's rule in the region could be another topic. I should also include the Jaipur State and its establishment date. Maybe include some key events like the formation of Rajasthan as a state in 1956.

Let me start with Rana Pratap Singh. He's a major figure, known for resisting Akbar. The Battle of Haldighati in 1576 is his most notable event. So a question on his resistance against whom. Then maybe a question on the establishment of Jaipur in 1727. The Pratihara Empire's capital was at Avanti, which is Ujjain, but Rajasthan's connection might be different. Wait, the Pratihara dynasty's capital was in Avanti, but they ruled over parts of Rajasthan as well. So a question on their capital.

Chittorgarh Fort is a UNESCO site since 1986. Need to confirm the year. Also, the ruler who merged Rajput states into the Indian Union after independence, that would be Rajendra Singh Bhatia. Then the founder of the Kachwaha dynasty, which established Amber, is Raja Man Singh I. The ruler who introduced the practice of Sati is Raja Ratan Singh, who banned it in 1303. The last independent ruler of Mewar, Rana Uday Singh, who died in 1572. The Mewar ruler who fought against Akbar and was defeated at Haldighati, which is Rana Pratap himself.

Wait, the question about the Mewar ruler who died in 1572, that would be Rana Uday Singh. Then the founder of the Jaipur State, Sawai Jai Singh II, who established it in 1727. The ruler who merged Rajasthan states with the Indian Union after independence, Rajendra Singh Bhatia, was the Maharaja of Jaipur who played a role. Also, the ruler who introduced the system of land revenue in Rajasthan, Sawai Jai Singh II is known for that, but I need to confirm.

Wait, Sawai Jai Singh II founded Jaipur and is known for astronomical observatories, but land revenue might be a different ruler. Maybe Raja Man Singh I? Or another ruler. Let me check. The land revenue system in Rajasthan was reformed by Sawai Jai Singh II, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be the British period. Hmm. Maybe another angle. The ruler who merged the Rajput states into the Indian Union in 1947-48 was Rajendra Singh Bhatia. That's correct.

Another topic: The ruler of Mewar who was defeated by Akbar at Chittorgarh in 1568 was Rana Udai Singh II. Then Rana Pratap succeeded him. So a question on who was defeated by Akbar at Chittorgarh. Also, the ruler of Bikaner who died in a battle against the Mughals might be Rao Chandrasen, but I need to verify. Wait, Rao Chandrasen was a ruler of Bikaner, but the death in battle against Mughals is a different story. Maybe Rao Chandra Sena? Or another ruler.

Wait, Rao Chandra Sena of Bikaner died in 1516 while fighting against the Mughals. But the Mughals came later. Maybe the Bikaner ruler who died in battle against the Mughals is Rao Chandra Sena. Alternatively, maybe a different ruler. I need to confirm. Alternatively, the ruler of Bikaner who died in a battle against the Mughals is Rao Chandra Sena, but I'm not certain. Maybe another example. The founder of the Marwar kingdom was Rao Chandra Sena, who established Jodhpur in 1459. So a question on the founder of Jodhpur.

Putting it all together, here's a list of possible questions:

1. Rana Pratap Singh's resistance against Akbar.
2. Founder of Jaipur State: Sawai Jai Singh II in 1727.
3. Chittorgarh Fort as a UNESCO site since 1986.
4. Raja Man Singh I founded the Kachwaha dynasty.
5. Rajendra Singh Bhatia integrated Rajasthan states into India.
6. Founder of Marwar kingdom: Rao Jodha, who established Jodhpur in 1459.
7. Rana Sanga, the Mewar ruler who died in 1528, but the one who fought at Haldighati was Rana Pratap. Wait, the question about the ruler who died in 1572 is Rana Uday Singh.
8. The ruler who banned Sati: Raja Ratan Singh in 1303.
9. The Mewar ruler defeated by Akbar at Chittorgarh in 1568: Rana Udai Singh II.
10. Founder of Ajmer: Quwwam-ud-din Ilyas Shah, but that's part of Delhi Sultanate. Alternatively, Ajmer was a Rajput kingdom, but maybe a different angle. Alternatively, the ruler who established Ajmer as a capital? Wait, Ajmer was ruled by Rajputs, but maybe the founder of the city is a different question. Alternatively, maybe the ruler who merged Ajmer into the Indian Union. Hmm, perhaps a different question. Maybe the ruler who established the first Rajput kingdom in Rajasthan. Alternatively, the founder of the Chauhan dynasty in Rajasthan, which is Prithviraj Chauhan. But he was a Delhi ruler. Wait, the Chauhans in Rajasthan, their capital was Ajmer. So the question could be about the founder of the Chauhan dynasty in Rajasthan. That would be Arnoraja, who established Ajmer. He founded the Chauhan dynasty in Rajasthan in the 8th century.

Wait, the Chauhan dynasty in Rajasthan was founded by Arnoraja in the 8th century, with Ajmer as their capital. So a question on the founder of the Chauhan dynasty in Rajasthan.

So compiling all these into 10 questions. Each with options in English and Hindi, explanations in both languages. Need to ensure the options are plausible and the answers are accurate. Also, the difficulty level should be set according to Rajasthan History topics typically asked in these exams.
