Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants 10 high-quality MCQs on Rajasthan History, specifically for exams like LDC, CET, RAS, SSC, and Railway. The questions need to be in both Hindi and English, with explanations in both languages too. The format has to be strict JSON and follow the Testbook style.

First, I need to recall key topics in Rajasthan History. Important events, dynasties, historical figures, and cultural aspects come to mind. Let's brainstorm some areas: Mughal era in Rajasthan, Maratha conflict, rulers like Maharana Pratap, historical events like the Battle of Haldighati, formation of Rajasthan state, famous battles, and notable historical sites.

For each question, I need two distinct options. Let's start with the first question about the ruler of Mewar who defeated Akbar at Haldighati. The answer is Maharana Pratap. Then, check the battle details. Next, maybe a question on the founder of Ajmer. It was Prithviraj Chauhan. Another could be about the ruler who defeated the Mughals in the Battle of Khanwa. Rana Sanga comes to mind.

I should ensure that the options are plausible but not too obvious. For example, when asking about the ruler who accepted the Mughal suzerainty, Raja Man Singh comes to mind, but I need to confirm. Also, the question about the famous ruler of Marwar during the 18th century—Raja Jawahar Singh.

Another point is the historical capitals. Udaipur was the capital of Mewar, so a question on that might work. The formation of Rajasthan as a state in 1956. The Battle of Dharmat, where Rao Maldeo defeated the Mughals. The ruler who founded the city of Jodhpur—Rao Jodha. The ruler who accepted the Mughal suzerainty after the Battle of Haldighati—Maharaja Man Singh. Wait, no, that might be a different battle. Need to verify.

I need to double-check the correct answers to avoid mistakes. For example, Rao Maldeo was a Rathore ruler of Marwar. The Battle of Dharmat was against the Mughals led by Akbar. The correct answer there is Rao Maldeo. The ruler who founded Jodhpur is Rao Jodha. Also, the ruler who accepted Mughal suzerainty after Haldighati might be Maharaja Man Singh, but I need to confirm. Wait, after Haldighati, the Mewar ruler was Maharana Pratap, but he didn't accept suzerainty immediately. Maybe that's a different question.

I should also include events like the formation of Rajasthan state in 1956. Another topic could be the ruler who shifted the capital to Jaipur—Sawai Jai Singh. For the question on the ruler who defeated the Mughals in the Battle of Samugarh, it was Durgadas Rathore, but that's after Haldighati. Hmm, maybe need to adjust the question wording.

Let me structure each question step by step, ensuring accuracy and clarity. Each question should have four options, with the correct answer clearly marked. The explanations need to be concise but informative. Once all 10 questions are drafted, I'll review them for any errors or inconsistencies in the facts.
