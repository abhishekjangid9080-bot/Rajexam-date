Okay, the user wants me to create 10 high-quality MCQs on Rajasthan History for exams like LDC, CET, RAS, SSC, and Railway. Let me start by recalling important topics in Rajasthan History. The main areas would include ancient kingdoms, Mughal and Rajput history, important rulers, historical events, and cultural aspects.

First, I need to ensure the questions are in both Hindi and English, following the Testbook style. Each question should have four options, with the correct answer and explanations in both languages. The JSON structure provided must be strictly followed, with the right keys and no extra text.

Let me think of the first topic. The oldest known dynasty in Rajasthan is the Maurya dynasty, but since Rajasthan's region was part of Maurya Empire, maybe the Kshatriya dynasties like the Guhila, Chauhan, etc., are more relevant. Wait, the earliest known dynasty in Rajasthan is the Maurya dynasty? No, Rajput dynasties came later. Maybe the correct answer is the Maurya Empire as it was the first to include Rajasthan. Hmm, need to verify that.

Next, the founder of the Marwar kingdom. Marwar is Jodhpur, and the founder is Rao Jodha. That's a good question. Then, the ruler who shifted the capital from Chittorgarh to Udaipur was Maharana Udai Singh II. Another question could be about the ruler who defeated the Mughals, maybe Maharana Pratap. The Battle of Haldighati? Yes.

For the question about the ruler with the longest reign, Rao Malik Deva of Bikaner is known for a long reign. The founder of the Mewar kingdom is Bappa Rawal. The ruler who established the capital at Jaipur is Sawai Jai Singh II. The Battle of Khanwa in 1527, fought by Babur against Rana Sanga. The ruler who shifted the capital from Chittorgarh to Udaipur is Udai Singh II. The founder of the Amber kingdom is Raja Man Singh I. The historical site of Mehrangarh Fort is in Jodhpur. The ruler involved in the Battle of Khanwa is Rana Sanga. The ruler who introduced the system of revenue collection in Rajasthan is Raja Man Singh I. Wait, maybe that's not accurate. Revenue systems were implemented by various rulers, but Raja Man Singh might not be the correct answer. Let me check. Maybe Sawai Jai Singh introduced some systems. Hmm, need to be careful here.

I should also ensure that the questions are not too similar and cover different aspects. Let me list out possible topics:

1. Oldest dynasty in Rajasthan
2. Founder of Marwar (Jodhpur)
3. Ruler who shifted capital to Udaipur
4. Ruler who defeated Mughals (Maharana Pratap)
5. Longest-reigning ruler (Rao Malik Deva)
6. Founder of Mewar kingdom (Bappa Rawal)
7. Founder of Jaipur (Sawai Jai Singh II)
8. Battle of Khanwa (Rana Sanga vs Babur)
9. Founder of Amber kingdom (Raja Man Singh I)
10. Historical site of Mehrangarh Fort (Jodhpur)

Now, I need to phrase each question clearly. For example, for the first question, the answer is the Maurya Empire, as they were the earliest to rule the region, but Rajput dynasties came later. Wait, the Maurya Empire included parts of Rajasthan, but the native Rajput dynasties like the Guhila started later. Hmm, maybe the correct answer for the first question is the Maurya Empire. Alternatively, if the question is about the oldest indigenous dynasty, then Guhila. Need to clarify. Since the question is about the oldest known dynasty, the Maurya Empire would be the answer as they ruled the area first. However, Rajput dynasties came after. Let me confirm this.

Also, for the revenue collection system, maybe it's Sawai Jai Singh. But I'm not sure. Let me check. Raja Man Singh I introduced some administrative systems. Maybe that's the case. Need to verify. Alternatively, Rao Malik Deva might have implemented revenue reforms. This part needs to be accurate. If unsure, maybe avoid or find a better topic.

Once the topics are set, I can structure each question with appropriate options, making sure to include common distractors. For example, in the question about the founder of Marwar, common options could be Rao Jodha, Raja Man Singh, Rao Maldeo, etc.

I need to ensure that the answers are correct and the explanations are concise. Also, the difficulty level should be appropriate for Rajasthan State Exams, so they should test knowledge of key historical facts without being too obscure.

Finally, format each question into JSON as specified, with Hindi and English versions, and answers marked correctly. Double-check the JSON structure to avoid errors.
