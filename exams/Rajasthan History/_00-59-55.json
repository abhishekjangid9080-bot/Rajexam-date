Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality MCQs for Rajasthan History, covering exams like LDC, CET, RAS, SSC, and Railway. Let me start by recalling key topics in Rajasthan's history. Important periods include the Mauryan, Gupta, Rajput, Mughal, and British eras. Also, significant rulers like Rana Pratap, Maharana Sanga, and the Marwar rulers come to mind.

First question: Who was the founder of the Rajput dynasty in Rajasthan? The answer is Porus, but wait, Porus was from Punjab. Maybe it's Bappa Rawal who founded the Guhilot dynasty. That's a solid question.

Second question: Which Mughal emperor defeated Maharana Sanga? Babar? No, it was Ibrahim Lodi. Wait, no, the Battle of Khanwa was between Babar and Rana Sanga. So the answer is Babar.

Third question: The city of Ajmer was founded by? Ajmer is associated with Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, but the founder might be Prithviraj Chauhan. Wait, Ajmer was founded by Ajaypal Chauhan, but I need to confirm. Alternatively, Ajmer was established as a city by the Chauhan ruler Ajaypal, and later Khwaja Moinuddin came there. So the answer is Ajaypal Chauhan.

Fourth question: Which ruler of Marwar is known as the 'Suraj Mal'? Suraj Mal is a name itself. Wait, Rao Chandra Singh of Marwar was known as Suraj Mal. That's a good point.

Fifth question: The Battle of Haldighati was fought between Rana Pratap and Akbar. Correct. That's a key event.

Sixth question: Who built the Chittorgarh Fort? Raja Rawal Pratap Singh? Or maybe Raja Ratan Singh? Wait, Chittorgarh Fort was built by the Mauryans? No, it was built by the Chauhans. Rani Padmini is associated with it. Let me check. Chittorgarh was constructed by the Chauhan king Chittor, hence the name. So the answer is Chittor Chauhan.

Seventh question: The founder of the city of Jodhpur was Rao Jodha. Correct. He established Jodhpur in 1459.

Eighth question: Which ruler of Rajasthan was known as 'Mansingh'? Raja Man Singh Tomar? No, Rajput ruler Raja Man Singh I of Amber (Jaipur) was known as Mansingh. But Rajasthan's own, maybe Rao Maldeo? No. Wait, Raja Man Singh of Amber was a Rajput ruler and a Mughal general. The question is about Rajasthan's ruler with the title Mansingh. Maybe Raja Man Singh I. So the answer is Raja Man Singh I.

Ninth question: The establishment of the city of Udaipur is attributed to Maharana Udai Singh II. Correct. He founded Udaipur in 1559.

Tenth question: Which of the following Rajput rulers was a contemporary of Alexander the Great? Porus comes to mind, the battle of Hydaspes. But Porus was from the Punjab region, not Rajput. However, he's a significant figure in Rajput history. So the answer is Porus.

Now, I need to structure each question with English and Hindi in both question and options. Ensure the difficulty level is appropriate for Rajasthan exams. Check for accuracy in historical facts. Make sure the explanations are concise and correct. Also, format the JSON as per the given example without any extra text.
