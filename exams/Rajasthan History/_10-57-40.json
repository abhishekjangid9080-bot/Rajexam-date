Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality MCQs on Rajasthan History for exams like LDC, CET, RAS, SSC, and Railway. Let me start by recalling important topics in Rajasthan's history. The main areas could be ancient kingdoms, medieval rulers, historical events, and notable figures. 

First question: Maybe about the founder of Mewar Kingdom. Rana Sanga is a key figure. Let me check his significance. Yes, he was a prominent ruler. The options should include other important Rajput rulers like Maharana Pratap and Raja Man Singh.

Second question: The rise of the Marwar Kingdom. Rao Chandrasen is known for founding Marwar. Options could include other rulers like Rao Maldeo and Rao Jodha. I need to confirm their correct periods.

Third topic: The Battle of Haldighati. It's between Maharana Pratap and Akbar. The date is important here. The options should have different years, with the correct one being 1576. Also, the outcome where the Rajputs were defeated.

Fourth: The founder of Jodhpur. Rao Jodha established it in 1459. Other options like Rao Chandrasen and Rao Maldeo should be included to test knowledge.

Fifth: The ruler who defeated the Mughals at the Battle of Saraighat. But wait, Saraighat is in Assam. Maybe I should pick another battle. Alternatively, Raja Man Singh's role against Akbar is notable. Wait, Man Singh was an ally, not a ruler. Let me think again. Maybe the Battle of Mandore, where Rao Maldeo fought against Mughals. That could be a good question.

Sixth: The founder of the Shekhawati region. Rao Shekha is the name. Other options like Rao Bika and Rao Chandrasen. Need to confirm who founded Shekhawati.

Seventh: The ruler associated with the construction of the City Palace in Jaipur. Sawai Jai Singh is the correct answer. Options could include Maharaja Sawai Man Singh and Raja Man Singh.

Eighth: The historical site of Dilwara Temples. They are in Mount Abu, built by the Chandelas? Wait, no, the Dilwara Temples are Jain temples built by the Parmar dynasty. Need to verify that. The correct builder might be Tejaji or another ruler. Also, the location is definitely Mount Abu.

Ninth: The ruler of Mewar who defeated the Mughals in the Battle of Khanwa. Wait, Khanwa was a battle between Babur and Rana Sanga. The outcome was a Mughal victory. So the question could be about who lost the Battle of Khanwa. The correct answer is Rana Sanga.

Tenth: The founder of the Amber Kingdom. Raja Man Singh I established it. Other options like Raja Bharmal and Raja Jai Singh. Need to confirm the dates and correct founder.

Now, I need to structure each question with English and Hindi translations. Ensure that the options are in both languages. The explanations should be concise and accurate. Also, check the difficulty level to match Rajasthan exams' standards. Avoid any markdown and stick to the JSON format as provided. Let me verify each point for accuracy and clarity.
