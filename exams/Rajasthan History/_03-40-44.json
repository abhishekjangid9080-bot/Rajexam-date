Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality MCQs for Rajasthan History, specifically focusing on the given topic. The user wants each question in both Hindi and English, with options in both languages. The format should strictly follow the JSON structure they provided. Let me start by recalling key events and important periods in Rajasthan's history.

First, Rajasthan's history is rich with various dynasties like the Mauryas, Guptas, Rajputs, Mughals, and later the British. Important rulers and battles come to mind. For example, Maharana Pratap is a significant figure known for his resistance against the Mughals. The Battle of Haldighati is a key event. Also, the formation of the modern state of Rajasthan in 1956 under the States Reorganization Act is important.

I should cover different time periods to ensure comprehensive coverage. Let me think of topics: ancient kingdoms, medieval period, Mughal invasions, Rajput struggles, British colonization, and the formation of Rajasthan state. Each question should test specific knowledge points.

For each question, I need to make sure that the options are plausible but distinct. For example, when asking about the founder of Marwar, options could include different rulers from that region. Also, dates of events need to be accurate, and explanations must be concise in both languages.

I need to check the difficulty level appropriate for exams like LDC, CET, RAS, SSC, and Railway. They shouldn't be too easy but also not overly complex. Each question should have a clear correct answer supported by historical facts.

Let me start drafting the first question about the founder of Marwar. Then move to the Battle of Haldighati, the ruler who merged into British India, the formation of Rajasthan state, the ruler who built a lake, the Mughal emperor who attacked Chittorgarh, the ruler known as 'Bhakt Singh,' the treaty that ended the Rajput-Mughal conflict, the founder of Jodhpur, and the ruler who died at Haldighati.

I need to ensure that the options are in both Hindi and English, matching correctly. Also, the explanations should clarify why the correct answer is right. Let me verify the dates and names for accuracy. For example, Maharana Pratap died at Haldighati in 1576, and the States Reorganization Act was in 1956. Raja Man Singh I was the founder of Jodhpur.

Wait, I should confirm the founder of Marwar. Some sources say it was Rao Chanda of the Rathore dynasty. Also, the treaty that ended the conflict with the Mughals was the Treaty of Mandi in 1587. The ruler known as 'Bhakt Singh' is Raja Man Singh Tomar of Gwalior, but wait, in Rajasthan context, maybe it's another ruler. Hmm, perhaps Raja Man Singh I of Amber, but I need to verify that.

Also, the lake built by Raja Man Singh I is Man Sagar Lake. The ruler who merged into British India was Sardar Singh of Mewar, but I should check that. Wait, some states merged under the British through different treaties. Maybe it's Sardar Singh of Mewar, but I need to confirm.

I need to make sure all the facts are correct to avoid errors. Let me cross-reference each point. Once that's done, structure each question in the required JSON format with both languages and explanations.
