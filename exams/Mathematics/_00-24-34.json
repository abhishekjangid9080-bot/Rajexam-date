Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants me to create 10 high-quality Mathematics MCQs for Rajasthan State Exams, SSC, and Railway NTPC. The questions and options need to be in both Hindi and English, following the Testbook style. I need to make sure each question is structured in JSON format as per the example provided. 

First, I need to choose appropriate topics in Mathematics that are commonly covered in these exams. Topics like Simple Interest, Profit and Loss, Ratio and Proportion, Time and Distance, and Mensuration are typical. Let's brainstorm some questions under these topics.

Starting with Simple Interest. Let's create a question where a principal amount is invested at a certain rate and time. For example, ₹2000 invested at 5% per annum for 2 years. The formula is SI = PRT/100. Calculating that gives ₹200. The question should ask for the amount after 2 years, which would be principal plus interest, so ₹2200. Then translate the question and options into Hindi.

Next, Profit and Loss. Suppose a shopkeeper buys an item for ₹1200 and sells it for ₹1320. Profit is 120. Percentage is (120/1200)*100 = 10%. The question in English and Hindi needs to reflect this scenario.

Ratio and Proportion: A sum divided between two people in the ratio 3:2. If the total is ₹1000, then the shares are ₹600 and ₹400. The question asks for the difference between their shares, which is ₹200. Translating the ratio into Hindi correctly is important.

Time and Distance: A car traveling at 60 km/h for 5 hours covers 300 km. The question is straightforward here.

Mensuration: Area of a rectangle with length 15 cm and breadth 10 cm is 150 cm². Need to present this in both languages.

Another question could be on work and time. For example, if two people working together can finish a job in 6 days, what's the individual time? Wait, maybe a different approach. If A can do a job in 10 days and B in 15 days, together they can do it in 6 days. Let me verify that: 1/10 + 1/15 = 3/30 + 2/30 = 5/30 = 1/6. So together they take 6 days. So the question could ask how long they take together.

Percentage: If a student scores 450 out of 600, percentage is (450/600)*100 = 75%.

Number System: Find the LCM of 12 and 18, which is 36. Or HCF of 24 and 36, which is 12.

Algebra: Solving a simple equation like 2x + 5 = 15. Solution is x = 5.

Data Interpretation: Maybe a bar graph question, but since the user didn't specify, perhaps a simpler one like finding the average of numbers.

Wait, the user mentioned Mathematics, so let's ensure the topics cover various areas. Let me list the topics again: Simple Interest, Profit and Loss, Ratio, Time and Distance, Mensuration, Work and Time, Percentage, LCM/HCF, Algebra, and maybe another topic like Number System.

Need to make sure each question is distinct and covers different concepts. Also, check that the difficulty level is appropriate for the exams mentioned. The answers should be accurate, and explanations clear in both languages. Translating the explanations correctly in Hindi is crucial. Let me verify each calculation again to avoid errors. Once all questions are drafted, structure them in JSON as per the example. Ensure the JSON syntax is correct with proper commas and brackets. No extra text, just the raw JSON.
