Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to create high-quality MCQs for Rajasthan State Exams, SSC, and Railway exams focusing on Ratio & Proportion and Partnership in Mathematics. First, I need to recall the key concepts in these topics. Ratio deals with comparisons between quantities, while proportion is about equality of ratios. Partnership problems usually involve dividing profits based on investment ratios and time periods.

I need to make sure the questions are in both Hindi and English, following the Testbook style. The difficulty should be appropriate for the mentioned exams. Let me start by brainstorming different types of questions. For Ratio & Proportion, maybe questions on finding the ratio of two quantities, dividing a sum in a given ratio, or solving proportion problems. For Partnership, calculating each partner's share in profit based on their investments and time.

Let me check each question for clarity and correctness. For example, the first question could be about dividing a sum in a given ratio. The second might involve a proportion problem where a ratio is maintained. Partnership questions might involve different investment periods. I need to ensure that the options are not too similar and that the correct answer is clear but the distractors are plausible.

I should also verify the calculations for each question. For instance, in a partnership problem where two people invest different amounts for different durations, the profit share is calculated using the product of investment and time. Let me go through each step to avoid mistakes. Also, the explanations need to be concise and in both languages.

Let me structure each question according to the JSON format provided. Ensure that all fields are filled correctly, including the subject, topic, question in both languages, options, answer, and explanations. Double-check for any typos or formatting issues. Once done, review the entire set to ensure variety in question types and coverage of both topics adequately.
