Okay, let's start. The user wants me to create 10 high-quality math MCQs for Rajasthan State Exams, SSC, and Railway. The subject is Mathematics, and the topic isn't specified, so I need to cover general topics relevant to these exams. First, I should recall common math topics for these exams—like arithmetic, algebra, geometry, ratio, percentages, profit and loss, time and work, etc.

Each question needs to be in both Hindi and English. The answer options must be labeled A to D, with the correct answer specified. Also, explanations in both languages are required. The JSON structure example provided shows the exact format, so I have to follow that strictly.

Let me think of the first question. Maybe a simple one on profit and loss. If an article is bought for 400 and sold for 450, what's the profit percentage? The answer would be 12.5%. I need to present this in both languages.

Next, a question on finding HCF. For example, HCF of 60 and 75. The HCF is 15. That's straightforward.

Third question could be about averages. If the average of 5 numbers is 20, and adding one more number makes the average 22, find the new number. The explanation would involve total sum calculations.

Fourth question: Ratio problem. Dividing 100 into two parts in the ratio 3:2. The parts would be 60 and 40.

Fifth question: Time and work. If A can do a job in 10 days and B in 15 days, together they can do it in 6 days. So the time taken together is 6 days.

Sixth question: Simple interest. Principal is 5000, rate 5%, time 2 years. Simple interest is 500. So total amount is 5500.

Seventh question: Geometry—finding the area of a circle with radius 7 cm. Area is πr², so 154 cm².

Eighth question: Algebra—solving a linear equation like 3x + 5 = 20. x would be 5.

Ninth question: Percentage increase. If a number increases from 80 to 100, the percentage increase is 25%.

Tenth question: Time and distance. A train moving at 60 kmph crosses a 200m long platform in 20 seconds. Finding the length of the train. Speed in m/s is (60*1000)/3600 = 50/3 m/s. Total distance covered is speed*time = (50/3)*20 = 1000/3 ≈ 333.33 meters. Length of train = total distance - platform length = 333.33 - 200 = 133.33 meters, which is approximately 133.33 m.

Now, translating all these into both Hindi and English, ensuring the options are correctly labeled, and the explanations are clear. Need to check for any calculation errors and ensure the JSON structure is correct with proper commas and brackets. Also, confirm that the answer keys are correctly assigned (A, B, C, D) based on the options.
