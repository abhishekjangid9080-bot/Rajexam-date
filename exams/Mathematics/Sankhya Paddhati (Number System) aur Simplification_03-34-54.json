Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality MCQs for Mathematics on Number System and Simplification for Rajasthan exams and others. Let me start by recalling the key concepts in Number System and Simplification. Topics like types of numbers (prime, composite, even, odd), divisibility rules, simplification using BODMAS, LCM, HCF, fractions, decimals, and maybe some word problems.

First question: Let me think about a prime number question. Maybe identifying a prime number among options. For example, 1. Which is not a prime number? Options could be 2, 3, 4, 5. The answer is 4. But wait, 4 is composite. That's a good starter.

Second question: Divisibility. Let's take a number like 12345. Check divisibility by 5. Since it ends with 5, divisible. So the question could be, which is divisible by 5? Options ending with 5 or 0. The answer is 12345.

Third question: Simplification with BODMAS. For example, 5 + 5 × 5 ÷ 5 – 5. Solve step by step. Division first: 5 × (5 ÷ 5) = 5 ×1. Then multiplication: 5 + 5 ×1 –5. Then addition and subtraction: 5 +5 -5 =5. So the answer is 5.

Fourth question: LCM of numbers. Maybe LCM of 12, 18, 24. Let me calculate. Prime factors: 12=2²×3, 18=2×3², 24=2³×3. LCM is highest powers: 2³×3²=8×9=72. So answer is 72.

Fifth question: HCF of numbers. Let's take 24 and 36. Factors of 24: 2³×3, 36: 2²×3². HCF is 2²×3=12. So the answer is 12.

Sixth question: Odd and even numbers. Which is even? Options like 13, 17, 22, 29. Answer is 22.

Seventh question: Simplifying fractions. 3/4 + 1/2 = ? Convert to common denominator: 3/4 + 2/4 = 5/4 or 1.25. So answer is 5/4.

Eighth question: Decimals. 0.75 × 0.25. Multiply 75×25=1875, then adjust decimal places: 0.75 has 2, 0.25 has 2, total 4. So 0.1875. Answer is 0.1875.

Ninth question: Word problem. A number multiplied by 4 gives 60. What is the number? 60 ÷4=15. Answer is 15.

Tenth question: Simplify using BODMAS again. Maybe something like (2 + 3) × (4 - 1) + 5. Solve inside brackets first: 5×3=15, then 15+5=20. Answer is 20.

Now, I need to make sure the questions are in both Hindi and English. Also, explanations in both languages. Let me check each question for clarity and correctness. For example, the first question's options should have 4 as the non-prime. The LCM and HCF examples need correct calculations. Also, the decimal multiplication should be correct. Let me verify all answers again to avoid mistakes. Once all are verified, format into JSON as per the example. Ensure the answer options are labeled A to D, and explanations are accurate. That should cover it.
