Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to create 10 high-quality math MCQs for Rajasthan and other exams. The topics aren't specified, so I need to cover a range of common math areas like arithmetic, algebra, geometry, etc. Each question must have Hindi and English translations, with answers and explanations. 

First, I'll start with arithmetic problems. Maybe percentages, ratios, and proportions. Then move to algebra for equations and quadratic problems. Geometry can include areas, triangles, or circles. Also, include some word problems for time and work or distance.

Need to ensure the difficulty level is appropriate for the exams mentioned—LDC, CET, RAS, etc. So, not too basic but not too advanced. Each question should have four options, with one correct answer. The explanations should be clear and concise in both languages.

Let me think of the first question. Perhaps a percentage problem. For example, calculating the percentage increase. Then a ratio problem where two quantities are compared. 

Next, an algebra question solving for x in a linear equation. Then a geometry problem about the area of a triangle using coordinates. Another question on profit and loss. Time and work problem involving two people working together. 

Quadratic equation solving with factoring. Maybe a problem on simple interest. Then an average question. Lastly, a problem on time, speed, and distance.

I need to check that all the numbers make sense and the calculations are correct. Also, translate each question accurately into Hindi without losing the meaning. The options should be in both languages, and the answer key should be correct. Explanations need to clarify why the correct answer is right, maybe showing steps.

Wait, the user provided an example with Rajasthan's capital, so the structure is clear. Each question must have subject, topic, question in both languages, options, answer, and explanations. The topic field is empty in the example, but maybe I should fill it with appropriate topics like "Percentage", "Ratio and Proportion", etc.

Let me start drafting each question. For example:

1. Percentage Increase: If the price of a product increases from 200 to 250, what's the percentage increase?
2. Ratio Problem: Divide 120 in the ratio 2:3.
3. Linear Equation: Solve 3x + 5 = 20.
4. Geometry Area: Find the area of a triangle with coordinates (1,1), (4,1), (1,5).
5. Profit and Loss: A shopkeeper sells a book for 270 Rs at a loss of 10%, find cost price.
6. Time and Work: A can do a work in 10 days, B in 15 days. Together in how many days?
7. Quadratic Equation: Solve x² - 5x + 6 = 0.
8. Simple Interest: Find the interest on 5000 at 5% p.a. for 2 years.
9. Average: Average of 5 numbers is 20, add 30, new average?
10. Time, Speed: A car travels 60 kmph, how long to cover 180 km?

Now, translating these into Hindi accurately. Ensuring options are shuffled properly. Answer keys must match. Explanations should be simple and in both languages. Check for any calculation errors. Once done, format into the required JSON structure without any extra text.
