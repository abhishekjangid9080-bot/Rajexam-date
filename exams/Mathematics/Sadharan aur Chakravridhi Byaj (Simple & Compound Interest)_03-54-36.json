Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality MCQs on Simple and Compound Interest in Hindi and English. Let me start by recalling the basic formulas. For simple interest, the formula is I = PRT/100, and the amount is P + I. For compound interest, the amount is P(1 + r/n)^(nt), and the interest is amount minus principal. 

First question: Let's ask for the simple interest on a principal amount. Maybe a standard problem where P=Rs 5000, R=5%, T=2 years. The answer would be 5000*5*2/100 = 500. So the options need to include 500.

Second question: Difference between CI and SI for 2 years. Let's take P=10000, R=10%. SI for 2 years is 10000*10*2/100=2000. CI is 10000*(1 + 0.1)^2 - 10000 = 11000 - 10000 = 1000. Wait, no, let me recalculate. (1.1)^2 is 1.21, so 10000*1.21=12100. CI is 2100. So difference is 2100 - 2000 = 100. So the answer is 100.

Third question: If a sum doubles in T years at SI, what is the rate? Let's say P doubles, so A=2P. So, SI = P. Time is T. So, P = P*R*T/100 => R = 100/T. So, if T is 10 years, R is 10%. Let me frame a question with T=10, answer is 10%.

Fourth question: CI for 1 year compounded half-yearly. Let's take P=8000, R=10% annual. Since compounded half-yearly, rate per period is 5%, and periods are 2. So amount is 8000*(1 + 0.05)^2 = 8000*1.1025 = 8820. CI is 820. So the question would have P, R, time=1 year, answer is 820.

Fifth question: Find the principal if CI after 2 years is given. Suppose CI is 441, R=5%, time=2. So, amount is P*(1 + 0.05)^2 = P*1.1025. CI is 441 = 1.1025P - P = 0.1025P. So P = 441 / 0.1025 = 4300. Wait, maybe easier numbers. Let me adjust. Suppose CI is 451, then P=451 / 0.1025 ≈ 4400. Hmm, maybe better to use 451. Let me check again. Alternatively, use R=10%, so (1.1)^2 = 1.21. CI is 0.21P. If CI is 210, then P=1000. So the question would be if CI is 210, P=1000.

Sixth question: Compare SI and CI for 3 years. Let's take P=10000, R=10%, T=3. SI is 10000*10*3/100=3000. CI is 10000*(1.1)^3 - 10000 = 13310 - 10000 = 3310. Difference is 310. So answer is 310.

Seventh question: Time required for a sum to become 1.5 times at SI. Let P become 1.5P. So SI=0.5P. Using formula, 0.5P = P*R*T/100 => T = 50/R. If R=10%, then T=5 years. So question could be R=10%, answer is 5 years.

Eighth question: CI for 2 years compounded annually. Let P=6000, R=8%. Amount is 6000*(1.08)^2 = 6000*1.1664=6998.4. CI is 998.4, so answer is 998.4.

Ninth question: Find rate if CI and SI are given for 2 years. Let's say SI is Rs 400 and CI is Rs 420. The difference is 20. For two years, the difference between CI and SI is P*(R/100)^2. So 20 = P*(R^2)/10000. Also, SI is 400 = P*R*2/100 => PR = 20000. So substituting PR=20000 into 20 = (20000*R)/10000 => 20 = 2R => R=10%. So answer is 10%.

Tenth question: A sum of money becomes 4 times in 10 years. What is the rate? If it becomes 4 times in 10 years at SI. Let P become 4P. So SI=3P. Using formula: 3P = P*R*10/100 => R=30%. So question would be, in 10 years, 4 times, answer is 30%.

Now, I need to translate all these into Hindi and English, ensuring the JSON structure is correct. Each question should have question_en, question_hi, options A-D in both languages, the correct answer, and explanations in both languages. Also, the difficulty level should be moderate to high, suitable for Rajasthan exams, SSC, and Railway. I need to check for any calculation errors and ensure that the options are correctly placed. Let me cross-verify each calculation once again to prevent mistakes.
