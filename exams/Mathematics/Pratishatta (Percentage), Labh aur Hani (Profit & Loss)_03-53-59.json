Okay, I need to create 10 high-quality MCQs for Mathematics, specifically on Percentage and Profit & Loss for Rajasthan State Exams like LDC, CET, RAS, SSC, and Railway NTPC. Let's start by recalling the key concepts in these topics.

First, for percentages, common questions might involve calculating percentages, percentage increase or decrease, or finding values based on percentages. Profit and loss questions usually involve cost price, selling price, profit percentage, loss percentage, marked price, and discounts.

I should ensure the questions are in Hindi and English, with both languages for each option. The answer and explanations need to be in both languages as well. The difficulty level should be moderate, as per the exams mentioned. Also, the JSON structure has to be strict, with no extra text.

Let me think of the first question. Maybe a percentage calculation. For example, if a shopkeeper sells an item for ₹450 and makes a 20% profit, what's the cost price? Wait, profit percentage is calculated on cost price. So, SP = CP + 20% of CP = 1.2 CP. Therefore, CP = SP / 1.2. Let's plug in numbers here.

Another question could be about loss percentage. Suppose an article is bought for ₹800 and sold for ₹600, find the loss percentage. That's (CP - SP)/CP * 100.

For the marked price and discount, maybe a question where a shopkeeper marks up the price by 50% and then gives a 20% discount. What's the overall profit percentage?

Also, combined percentage problems: If a student scores 80% in one subject and 70% in another, and the total marks are out of 150 and 100 respectively, what's the total percentage?

Wait, need to check if these concepts are covered in the syllabus. Rajasthan exams might have more practical problems related to daily life, like selling goods, discounts in shops, etc.

Let me outline the 10 questions:

1. Profit percentage calculation with given SP and profit amount.
2. Loss percentage calculation with given CP and SP.
3. Calculating SP when CP and profit percentage are known.
4. Finding the marked price after a discount given the SP and markup.
5. Combined percentage from two different subjects.
6. Successive discounts: two discounts applied on an item, find final SP.
7. Calculating the original price after consecutive percentage increases.
8. Finding the cost price when SP and loss percentage are given.
9. Profit percentage when two items are sold at the same SP but different profit and loss percentages.
10. Calculating the discount percentage given MP, SP, and CP.

Now, I need to translate these into Hindi and English, ensuring the options are in both languages. Also, the explanations should clarify the steps. Let me make sure the numbers are realistic and the options are confusing enough but correct.

For example, question 1: A person sells an article for ₹1200 and gains ₹200. What is the profit percentage? Here, CP = SP - profit = 1200 - 200 = 1000. Profit% = (200/1000)*100 = 20%. Options would include 15%, 20%, 25%, etc.

Another example: A shopkeeper bought a product for ₹500 and sells it for ₹600. What is the profit percentage? Answer is 20%, so options in multiples of 10% would be good.

Let me verify the math for each question to avoid errors. Also, check if the explanations are clear. For instance, when explaining a markup and discount, the steps should show how to calculate the effective price after markup and then discount.

I should also ensure that the answer options are in the correct order (A, B, C, D) and that the correct answer is correctly labeled. The JSON structure must be precise, with no syntax errors. Let me test one example to see if the structure matches the required format.

Yes, each question should have subject, topic, question in both languages, options in both, answer key, and explanations. Now, compiling all 10 with varied scenarios to cover different aspects of percentages and profit/loss.
